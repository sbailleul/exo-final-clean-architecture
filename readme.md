# Console task manager

La video explicative se trouve a cet url : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MDr0wsa-l8

## Purpose

Our objective is to build a task manager accessible from the command line.


## A task

A task is a description of an activity to be done.
This task have these additional properties:
- creation date
- due date (optional)
- close date (when status changed to close)
- state (predefined values: `[todo, pending, progress, done, cancelled, closed]`), _`todo` will be the 
default when a new task is created
- Subtasks (optional): an array of tasks

## Data

The persistence of the data of the tasks should be accessible and readable within simple text 
files: csv, json or even text files. It could be one file per task or one file for all tasks.

The persistence of the data should be done in a folder called ".consoleAgenda" under the profile 
of the user. 
For example : `/users/rui/.consoleagenda/data.json`

## UI

The application should be a simple command line application able to interact with the data.

 - list the tasks by creation date (first is more recent)
 - add a new task
 - remove a task
 - update task status
 - (optional) show tasks in different colors depending on their status

Each command need to unitary and self standing. A command do an action producing a result, 
then show the result and then quit the app (there is no interactive interface hiding some 
commands within the process of execution of the app)

example of executions :
- `agenda add -c "hello world"`
- `agenda add -d:2022-03-01 -c "finalize the agenda exercise"`
- `agenda list`
- `agenda update 123 -d:2022-04-01`
- `agenda remove 123`
- `agenda update 123 -s:done`

note: in our examples, command options `-c` means content, `-d` due date, `-s` status_

## Additional Rules

These are features of the app that are less important for a basic working app but we would 
like to have them later

- (optional) each execution of the app is logged in a file `log.txt` stored in the application 
folder `~/.consoleagenda/` with :
  - this format: `[status][yyyy-MM-dd:HHhmm,ss] command_arguments : optional_error`
  - where status: `[ok+] | [err]`
  - ex: `[err][2022-02-10:10h55,23] update 1 "hello world" : task #1 does not exist`
  - ex: `[ok+][2022-02-10:10h56,00] add "hello world"`
- (optional) overdue tasks (= tasks with due date in the past) should be presented in red, 
first before the other tasks

## Building on quality

Even if it's look like a simple app, we want to ensure that it works as expected and that it will 
be maintainable over time:
- there must be tests proving that the application is working as expected
- the design must be modular enough, respecting principles of composition of software to ensure 
separation of concerns, minimal coupling & maximal cohesion, stability of core parts and modularity
of concrete parts (data, interfaces, file system, log ...)


## Sample Data 

this json could be used as reference for your initial tests:

## Sample program to generate data

This is the sample program used to generate this sample data:

```csharp
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

ExerciceHelpers.CreateSampleData();

enum TaskState { todo, pending, progress, done, cancelled, closed}
record Task (
    DateTimeOffset Created, 
    DateTimeOffset? DueDate, 
    DateTimeOffset? CloseDate,
    string Description, 
    TaskState State = TaskState.todo, 
    string? Tag = null,
    IEnumerable<Task>? SubTasks = null);


static class ExerciceHelpers
{
    internal static void CreateSampleData()
    {
        var tasks = new[]
        {
            new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-1), DateTimeOffset.Now.AddHours(-8), null ,"init a project to create an app for my tasks",
                SubTasks: new []
                {
                    new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-1), null,null ,"init repo for the project", TaskState.done),
                    new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-1), null, null ,"create solution and project", TaskState.done),
                    new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-1), null, null ,"create a small poc to test formats", TaskState.progress)
                }),
            new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-3), DateTimeOffset.Now.AddHours(-1), null ,"make a design of my needs to manage my tasks", TaskState.progress),
            new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now, DateTimeOffset.Now.AddMonths(1), null,
                "get first feedback on my app with peers"),
            new Task(DateTimeOffset.Now.AddMonths(-1), DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-15), DateTimeOffset.Now.AddDays(-5),"brainstorm on what project to work on", TaskState.closed),
        };

        var jsonTasks = JsonSerializer.Serialize(tasks, new JsonSerializerOptions(){ WriteIndented = true});
        File.WriteAllText("data.txt",jsonTasks);
        var content = File.ReadAllText("data.txt");
        var newTasks = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<IEnumerable<Task>>(content);
        var serializedContentCheck = JsonSerializer.Serialize(newTasks,new JsonSerializerOptions(){ WriteIndented = true});

        Console.WriteLine($"content : {serializedContentCheck}");
    }
}
```
